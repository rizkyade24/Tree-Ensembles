# Tree-Ensembles

Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines several models to improve predictive performance. One of the most popular ensemble methods is **Random Forest**, which is a type of decision tree ensemble. Another popular method is **Gradient Boosting**, which involves fitting many decision trees on different samples of the same dataset and averaging the predictions.
